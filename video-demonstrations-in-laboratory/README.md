# Laboratory Video Demonstrations

This directory contains video demonstrations documenting the automated and remote control of laboratory instruments using Python scripts.  
The recordings illustrate the interaction between the control software and physical instrumentation during data acquisition and processing.

Demonstration include the measurement workflow, including device communication, experimental sequencing, and real-time visualization of acquired data.

## 1. Overview

The provided videos serve as a visual supplement to the main repository.  
They demonstrate how networked instruments can be remotely configured, controlled, and used for automated data acquisition within a Python-based environment.

The demonstrations are intended for educational and research purposes, particularly in the areas of electronics education, experimental automation, signal measurement, and instrument interfacing.
